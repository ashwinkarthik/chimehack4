    <h2>Water</h2>
    <ul>
    <li> Never drink sea water or urine, but if they're all you've got, you can boil them and collect the steam with a plastic sheet or bag. A solar still works similarly, but much, much, much slower </li>


    <li>A water filter is a porous substance such as activated carbon which removes sediment and unwanted substances such as harmful chemicals and toxins from our water. A water purifier is defined as2 a system that removes 90-95% of all contaminants in water</li>



    <li>If you're really stuck out there and have no other means, leaving a clear water bottle in the sun for a full day (if sunny) or two days (if cloudy) will kill bugs in the water via UV radiation
</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Shelter</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Create fires in a triangle as a symbol of distress</li>
    <li>You can use branches, rocks, or footsteps to make a giant SOS that can be seen from air.</li>
    <li>Use a tarp or a whistle to signal rescuers if you feel they are close.</li>
  </ul>
  </ion-slide>

  <ion-slide style="background-color: white">
    <h2>Food</h2>
     <ul>
    <li>All grasses are edible. The leaves can be chewed and the juices swallowed - though be sure to spit out the un-digestable fibers.</li>
    <li>Ants, grubs, and grasshoppers can be eaten. A good way to get over our natural resistance to eating bugs is to toss them into a stew with other ingredients.</li>
    <li>All freshwater fish are edible. In a survival situation, fish can be caught using a sharpened stick as a fish spear. For small minnows, a t-shirt can be used as a fish net.</li>
  </ul>
